| 8/29 |  2:55 - 3:00pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                            Created project and shared on Github. |
| 9/02 | 9:40pm - 10:00pm |                                                                                                                                               Worked through creating an array to represent the board. Began writing pseudocode. |
| 9/02 | 10:00 - 10:30pm  |                                                                                                                                      Looked back on MazeSolver to brainstorm ideas and wrote pseudocode detailing possibilities. |
| 9/02 | 10:30 - 10:40pm  |     Looked through rules a final time and added clauses to pseudocode. Thought through ideas and decided that a good possible solution could use recursioin and could start from the end of the board rather than the beginning. |
| 9/04 |  10:25-10:40am   |                                                                                                                                                            Thought through the problem in tutorial and asked about GitHub issue. |
| 9/05 |  11:25-11:55am   |                                                                                                                      Worked through beginning of people: created queue, started exploring node, and started created ladders map. |
| 9/05 |  7:30 - 7:55pm   |                                                                                     I worked through the pseudocode. I created maps and worked through the process of checking for snakes and ladders and already visited nodes. |
| 9/06 |   1:50-1:55pm    |                                                                                                                                                        Added return statement and started debugging out of bounds error for map. |
| 9/06 |  2:05 - 2:35pm   |                                                                                      I asked Mr. Blick for help with an out of bounds error, and used the debugger to sort out the other issues I was having when running tests. |
| 9/07 | 9:45 - 10:10 am  | Uncovered problem with rolls increasing - they are increasing too frequently because the node is always the lowest value which means adding 6 to it will have an increased roll. Tried to fix problem by adding an if statement. |
| 9/08 | 12:00 - 12:10pm  |                                                                                                               Tried to debug the number of rolls, still one or two off - not sure where to implement when rolls should increase. |
| 9/08 |  9:50- 10:20pm   |                                                                                                                                                                            I tried to debug my problem with the number of rolls. |
