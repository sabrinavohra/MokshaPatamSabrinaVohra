| 9/02 | 9:40pm - 10:00pm |                                                                                                                                           Worked through creating an array to represent the board. Began writing pseudocode. |
| 9/02 | 10:00 - 10:30pm  |                                                                                                                                  Looked back on MazeSolver to brainstorm ideas and wrote pseudocode detailing possibilities. |
| 9/02 | 10:30 - 10:40pm  | Looked through rules a final time and added clauses to pseudocode. Thought through ideas and decided that a good possible solution could use recursioin and could start from the end of the board rather than the beginning. |
| 9/04 |  10:25-10:40am   |                                                                                                                                                        Thought through the problem in tutorial and asked about GitHub issue. |
| 9/05 |  11:25-11:55am   |                                                                                                                  Worked through beginning of people: created queue, started exploring node, and started created ladders map. |
